Addons:
- SimplifyMultipleFCurves-v1_4.py- TrimFCurves.py

Can be installed with the standard procedure (User references, addons, install form file...)

Additional libraries:- websocket.py

It is needed when the Leap Motion receiver is used to directly connect to the websocket, instead of using the LeapForwarder (This is a flag in the source).
IF needed, must be copied manually into the Blender-embedded python installation:
Select the Blender app and right click "Show Package Contents" 
-> Contents/MacOS/2.xx/python/lib/python3.3/
