# 
# v00 first tests
# v01 Recursion and deletion works. Keyframe generation not present yet.
# v02 Added keyframe creation. Fixed split KF identification. Seems that all works.
# v03 Switched to keyframes storage approach to be able to destroy and recreate curves. Needed for switch to interactive in-place command.
# v04 Converted into an operator, for interactive curves editing.
# v05 Solved multiple references to shared mathutil.Vector around. Still crashing, even without deleting keyframes.
# v06 ... temporary working. Cannot store references to the FCurves selection during the first "execute()" call: they will be invalid at future invocations!!!
# v07 Fixed curves indexing and retrieval. Only data_path and array_index i stored, and used to retrieve curves from fresh selection list. Rooooocks!!!
# v08 Optimized surves storage.
# v09 Code cleanup. Debug prints removed.
# v10 Executed tests to keep tangents during frames reconstruction. Failed.
# v11 Fixed the management of curve borders in misaligned curves.
# v12 Implemented range selection (P key in F-Curve Editor)
# v13 Converted error selection to "Simplification Percentage" value in the range 0-100
# v14 Added Panel for selection in F-Curves editor. But failed to make pop-up, and percentage control is still in 3D View Tools panel.
# v15 Reworked execute method. Moved out code to share code with the second operator, which simplifies curves by specifying max KF number.
# v16 Implemented Simplification by "Max Keyframes" :-)
# v17 Simplifications and cleanups.
# v18 Optimization. Split curves simplification analysis from actual F-Curve keyframes reconstruction. Faster in error extimation when simplifying by Max KF.
# v1.0 Cleanups for first release
# v1.1 Changed simplification "by Percentage" in "by Error"
# v1.2 Minor edits for Blender plugin conformance: inserted GPLv3 header, removed log from file.
# v1.3 Some code cleanup
# v1.4 Added normalization option, to allow simplification of curves with different amplitudes
